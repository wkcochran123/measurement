# Measurement

This repository contains a developing axiomatic framework for measurement,
events, and refinement, together with a Lean 4 formalization of the early
chapters.

The project is intentionally split between two modes:

1. **Human-readable mathematical exposition**, and
2. **Machine-verified formal statements** in Lean.

Up through **Chapter 2**, these two views coincide. From that point onward,
the manuscript emphasizes the *shape* and consequences of the argument rather
than full formal rigor.

## Current status

- **Chapters 1 and 2**  
  Fully human-readable and accompanied by working Lean code.
  Core definitions, axioms, and early propositions are mechanically verified.

- **Chapter 3 and beyond**  
  The text gives more of a shape of the argument as the prose and rigor lack
  formality.  Read past chapter 2 at your own peril.  Chapter 3 is currently
  under development.
